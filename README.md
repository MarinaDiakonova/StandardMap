# StandardMap

Works with processing v3. Creates a statespace, so that a mouseclick initialises a trajectory. The only difference between the three files is the K parameter, which can of course also be set manually in the files.

Originally written in v2, back when it was possible to create apps and applets. No so now:( 

V2 verion worked really fast. This version is much slower. Possibly to do with a rather un-systematic conversion from v2 to v3 (of these files).
